/**
 * The analyst's rationale, split into the sections it is actually written in.
 *
 * It is Markdown — `**Rating**: Overweight`, then a blank line, then
 * `**Executive Summary**: …` — and it was being printed raw into a paragraph.
 * So a reader saw the asterisks, lost the section breaks, and read one
 * unbroken blob in a 680px measure beside analyst reports running to 1198px.
 * That is what made it look wrapped when the reports did not.
 *
 * **Parsed rather than rendered as Markdown.** The shape is fixed and known:
 * across 44 stored rationales from two different models, every one had
 * Rating, Executive Summary, Investment Thesis and Time Horizon, and 38 had
 * Price Target. Pulling five known labels out is smaller and more predictable
 * than adding a Markdown renderer for one field, and it degrades safely — an
 * unrecognised shape comes back as a single untitled section rather than
 * disappearing.
