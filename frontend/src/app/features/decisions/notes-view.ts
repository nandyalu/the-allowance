/**
 * Every note the agent has ever left, in one place.
 *
 * A note rides inside a decision pass's `orders`, so the Decisions page
 * already shows one wherever it happens to fall on that page's timeline —
 * but a note is not a decision about a ticker, it is the agent addressing
 * whoever maintains it, and CLAUDE.md calls it primary evidence about the
 * experiment's gaps. Reading "everything it has ever asked for" meant
 * opening every month on the Decisions page and picking the note cards out
 * by eye. This pulls them into their own list instead.
 *
 * A drill-down from Decisions rather than a seventh link in the main nav —
 * the nav is deliberately six curated destinations (see app.ts), and a note
 * is a detail of a decision pass the same way a ticker or an analysis is a
 * detail of a research pass.
 *
 * One flat fetch, not the Decisions page's month-by-month paging: a note is
 * a short line of text, so even the whole history of them is a small
 * payload, unlike a month of full prompts and responses.
