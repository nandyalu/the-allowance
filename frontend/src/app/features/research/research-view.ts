 * being watched; Signals listed the analyses of them. Split, a reader had to
 * hold "what a fresh look on one of these names costs" on one page and
 * "here is what that money bought" on another.
 *
 * Nothing here adds or removes a ticker. The agent commissions research to add
 * a name and untracks to drop one. Since 2026-09-08 nothing here runs on a
 * schedule: the agent decides for itself when a name is worth a fresh $0.05
 * look, holdings included, rather than every tracked name being charged and
 * analysed automatically each morning. The candidate list at the bottom is
 * the same menu it is shown in its prompt — it is here to be looked at, not
 * acted on.
