"""The agent choosing what to have analysed.

This is the experiment. The live agent is measured on decisions given a fixed
watchlist; this one decides what is worth looking at, under a budget the
research comes out of. Python's job is the same as everywhere else: refuse
what cannot be done, never reshape it.

Pure — no LLM, no broker.
