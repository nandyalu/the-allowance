"""Pages read the price cache; the agent asks the vendor.

The home page was taking 32 seconds to answer `/api/agent`, because building
the book fetches a live price per ticker and Webull's market-data endpoint is
paced at three seconds a call — a pace added on 2026-09-09 after it refused
524 calls in one day. Ten tracked tickers is half a minute, serialised.

**The split is the whole point of this file.** A page can show a price ten
minutes old; the agent cannot trade on one. If a future change routes a
decision through the cache, the agent starts placing orders at prices that no
longer exist, and nothing about that failure is loud.
