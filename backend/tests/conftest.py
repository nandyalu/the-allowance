"""Shared fixtures.

The daily bar cache sits between every caller and yfinance, so a test that used
to patch ``yfinance`` now has two seams to control: the network fetch and the
cache table. ``fake_bar_cache`` replaces the table with an in-memory dict so a
test never depends on what happens to be cached in the real database, and never
writes to it.
