"""The research page lists analyses newest first, within a day as well as across days.

Several analyses a day is the normal case here, not an edge one: eight on
2026-09-10 and nine on 2026-09-08 in the live book. ``signal_date`` is a
calendar date and cannot separate them, so the page showed 2026-09-10's 06:02
analysis above its 16:57 one.

The three filter branches disagreed with each other as well, which is why each
is pinned separately here.
