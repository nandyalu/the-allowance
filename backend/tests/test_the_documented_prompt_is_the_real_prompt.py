"""CLAUDE.md quotes the prompt. A quotation is stale the moment the original
moves, and this one had drifted three ways at once by 2026-09-10.

It quoted a system message still saying "paper-trading" a day after the code
dropped the word, and its rules list was missing two rules the agent actually
reads. **A wrong quotation there is worse than no quotation**, because that
file is what gets read instead of the code — by a contributor, and by me.

The drift was found by hand during a sweep. These tests catch it on the commit
that causes it.

**Only the mechanical half lives here.** CLAUDE.md deliberately paraphrases
some rules and abbreviates others with `[...]`, so a whole-list comparison
produces false positives and belongs in the `stale-check` skill, where a
person reads the hits. What is asserted here is exact: two verbatim strings,
and the three rules that must never be trimmed.
