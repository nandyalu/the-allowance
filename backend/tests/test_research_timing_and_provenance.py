"""The agent commissions research and is told why each analysis ran.

Recorded in CLAUDE.md under "What the experiment is for": give the agent
proper tools inside reasonable restrictions. A stock can move enough in a day
to be worth taking the profit or cutting the loss, and an agent that cannot
ask to look until tomorrow cannot act on that.

Until 2026-09-08 a research order also chose *when* the answer arrived —
"now" ran it straight away, anything else waited for the next morning's
sweep. The sweep is gone: every commission runs right after the pass that
asked for it, so that choice no longer exists. See JOURNEY.md.
