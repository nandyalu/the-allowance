"""Each deployment states its own start date.

The second container came up on 2026-09-09 and its home page said "day 8".
The date was a constant compiled into the frontend bundle, so every image
built from this repo claimed the first deployment's start however long that
particular container had been running.

Deliberately not derived from the data: the earliest recorded pass in the live
database is 2026-09-03 while the published start is the 2nd, and that gap is
intentional — the container was switched on that day and the first pass fell
after hours. Deriving it would replace a claim somebody made on purpose with
an artifact of scheduling.
