"""The concurrency footgun, pinned. It has shipped three times.

``for ticker in tickers: await run_analysis_and_record(ticker)`` looks
completely correct, passes review, and silently pins the whole batch to one
GPU: one LLM request is in flight at a time no matter how many backends the
pool has, so every extra card idles. On this hardware that is the difference
between about 43 minutes and about seven hours for fourteen tickers.

CLAUDE.md records that this exact bug shipped in the daily sweep, the watchdog
triggers, and the earnings check — three separate times, by people who knew
about it. It is invisible in a diff and produces no error, only a slow day.

``analysis.run_analyses()`` dispatches with ``asyncio.gather`` and lets the
shared semaphore do the bounding, which is the only correct way to analyse
more than one ticker.
