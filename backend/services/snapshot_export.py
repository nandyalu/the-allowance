"""Renders every public read page's data to static JSON, for Cloudflare Pages.

The public site used to be a second live copy of this app (``PUBLIC_MODE=1``),
kept read-only by a middleware check on the HTTP method. That still let one
real gap through: a read request's own database side effect (a price-cache
write in ``positions.get_current_price``) was not a request the middleware
ever saw. This module removes the live backend from the public path instead
of tightening the guard further — there is nothing here for a future bug like
that to hide in, because there is no server on the other end at all.

Every function below calls the *same* route handler the live private
dashboard already calls (``backend/api/routes/*.py``) — not a reimplementation
of its logic — and writes the handler's return value to a JSON file under
``OUTPUT_DIR``. Those handlers are plain functions with no FastAPI request
dependency, the same way every job in ``backend/tasks/scheduler.py`` already
calls service-layer functions directly, so calling them here needs no HTTP
round trip and can never drift from what the live route returns.

Never raises. A scheduled export that failed loudly would take the whole job
down over one bad ticker; ``_safe`` catches and logs instead, the same
discipline ``journey.write_month_files`` uses for the same reason.
