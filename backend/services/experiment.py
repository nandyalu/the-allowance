"""When *this* deployment's experiment began.

The date was a constant compiled into the frontend bundle, which is fine while
one container runs and wrong the moment a second one does: every image built
from this repo carried the same date, so a container started today announced
itself as being on day eight of somebody else's experiment.

**Configurable, defaulting to the date already published.** An unset variable
resolves to 2026-09-02, so the original deployment's site does not move and no
page it has ever served changes.

**Deliberately not derived from the data.** The earliest recorded pass in the
live database is 2026-09-03, while the published start is the 2nd, and that gap
is intentional: the container was deployed and switched on that day and the
first pass simply fell after hours. Deriving the date would replace "when this
experiment began" — a claim somebody made on purpose — with "when it first
happened to produce a row", which is an artifact of scheduling.

``intraday.experiment_start()`` reads this too — a floor for how far back to
backfill 1-minute bars. It was a separate constant until 2026-09-10, on the
reasoning that a floor is not a claim about when anything began. True, and
beside the point: a self-hoster starting four months from now would have
paged back four months to reach somebody else's date.
