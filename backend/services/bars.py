"""Read-through cache for daily OHLCV bars.

Before this existed, each caller fetched independently: the intraday watchdog
pulled roughly a month of bars per ticker *every 15 minutes* to use two
closes and a volume average, while the chart, the ATR, and signal grading
each refetched overlapping ranges of the same bars. On an 8-ticker watchlist
that was a few hundred fetches a day to persist eight numbers.

The saving is possible because **a completed session never changes**. Only the
bar for the day in progress moves, and that one is deliberately never cached —
storing it would serve a frozen mid-session snapshot as though it were a close.
Callers that need today ask for it explicitly and get a live fetch.

**Webull first, yfinance as fallback (2026-09-08).** Every fetch used to go
through yfinance alone. Confirmed live that day: Webull's history-bar
endpoint pages back with no real depth ceiling at daily granularity either
(reached 2001 in testing, in full 1,200-bar pages) — the same endpoint
already relied on for intraday bars (backend/services/intraday.py). yfinance
stays as the fallback rather than being removed: it is what already produces
the "possibly delisted" false positives and 429s documented elsewhere in
this app, and a Webull outage must not take the daily cache down with it the
way removing the fallback would.

Everything here is blocking (network + DB) — call via asyncio.to_thread.
