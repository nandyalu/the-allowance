"""What this deployment still needs before it can run.

Everything here was configured through environment variables a person found by
reading documentation, and everything that went wrong said so only in a log
line nobody was watching. A container came up looking healthy, placed no
orders, and the reason was one `docker logs` away.

**This module reports whether something is configured and never what it is
configured to.** No function returns a key, a secret, or an account number,
and nothing that calls it may add one. That is not tidiness — it is the
security design. ``snapshot_export.py`` writes the settings payload to
``settings.json`` and pushes it to Cloudflare Pages, so a field that can carry
a secret is a field that can publish one. A check that never reads the value
cannot leak it, whatever anyone adds to the exporter later.

**Secrets and guards deliberately stay in the environment.** The obvious
version of this puts the Webull keys on a settings page; a credential in
``BotSetting`` is one careless ``_dump()`` from a public website, and a guard
the app can rewrite from a browser is not a guard. This page teaches — it
shows the lines to paste and says to restart — and stores nothing.
