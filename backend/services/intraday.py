"""1-minute intraday price bars, sourced from Webull's history-bar endpoint.

Unlike the daily bar cache (backend/services/bars.py), which reads through
yfinance, this reads through Webull. yfinance enforces a hard 8-day window on
1-minute history — Yahoo's own limit, confirmed live 2026-09-08, not
something a bigger request or a different library call can work around.
Webull's history-bar endpoint has no such ceiling in practice: paging
backward with ``end_time``, a live test against the sandbox market-data
endpoint that day pulled 5-minute bars from May and 15-minute bars from
January with no sign of a real cutoff, and six rapid-fire calls showed no
rate-limiting either.

Kept separate from quotes.py rather than folded into it: that module answers
"the price right now," this one answers "what did the price do," and the two
have different enough failure modes to want their own log lines. It does
reuse quotes' lazily-built Webull client and category cache rather than
duplicating that setup.
