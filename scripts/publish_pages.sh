# Publishes the static public site, on a loop.
#
# The site is two things that change at very different rates. The Angular
# shell is baked into this image and changes only when the container is
# rebuilt — about once a month. The exporter's JSON
# (backend/services/snapshot_export.py) changes every 15 minutes.
#
# **R2_SNAPSHOT_BUCKET decides which of two shapes this runs in.**
#
# Unset, every round bundles the shell and the data together and deploys both
# to Cloudflare Pages. That needs no setup beyond a Pages token and is what a
# self-hosted copy gets.
#
# Set, the shell is deployed to Pages once at startup and the data goes to an
# R2 bucket on its own domain, uploading only the files whose contents
# actually changed. The reason is deployment count. Cloudflare refuses to
# delete a Pages project with more than a hundred deployments, and a deploy
# every 15 minutes makes 96 a day. Measured on this deployment: 89 files and
# 3.9 MB, all 89 rewritten every round and almost none of them different.
